### What is happening?
On December 7, 2023, Amazon's broadcasting platform Twitch announced that it would terminate its service in South Korea due to communication fees that it could no longer afford. 

Starting in 2022, Twitch has made efforts in various ways, such as lowering the maximum quality of broadcast transmission to 720p and applying P2P communication method, to reduce the increasing burden due to communication fees in Korea as much as possible and to continue maintaining service in Korea.

However, due to communication fees, the service could no longer be provided in Korea, and Twitch eventually left Korea.

In order to somehow maintain service in Korea, Twitch even considered bypassing the server to a foreign country or lowering the video quality to 480p, but in the end, all were rejected as they had little effect and caused significant damage.

In fact, Twitch is not the only one experiencing problems with fees.
